Hello, I am Vicente Reyes, but people call me Vicho. I studied Computer Science[^titulo] at the University of Chile.

### About my blog

I have a blog here because I believe in the whole "small web" thing, about writing outside social networks. There will sometimes be posts in spanish.

It wasn't hard to set it up! I didn't want to go through the hassle of installing Jekyll,
so this blog is a fork of [this project](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with very few modifications.
I could even add Disqus comments easily if I wanted to.

### Contact me

I should set up mails to this domain.
In the meantime, you can send me an email at [almuerzo-bajadas.0k@icloud.com](mailto:almuerzo-bajadas.0k@icloud.com).

[^titulo]: Sort of. The name of my degree is "Ingeniero Civil en Computaci√≥n", which translates more closely to "Computer Engineering", with the "Civil" being there for chilean historical reasons.
