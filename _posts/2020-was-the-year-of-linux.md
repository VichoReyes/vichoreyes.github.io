title: 2020 was the Year of the Linux Desktop

Or, at least, it's going to be the closest it ever got to making it.

## What did Linux achieve in 2020?

According to web metrics, Linux desktop usage got to a peak of 2,5% i think somewhere around that,
which is the highest it's ever been. Possible explanations include people using their
personal computers instead of their work-issued ones, having more free time to try out
different operating systems, students having to install programs they only used on their
university computers before, etc.

Aside from the explosion in popularity of the Raspberry Pi 4 and similar SBCs, some traditional
computer manufacturers have embraced Linux distros recently. This year, Lenovo started selling
Thinkpads with Fedora installed[^1]

Wine and similar tools are now great. A look at protondb shows most games running without
major issues on Linux. The size of the
[linux_gaming subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming) grew from X to Y in just 2 years.
Proton became a force to be reckoned with.

Some of the most awaited releases of free software applications happened close to this year.
Blender 2.80 came out in 2019, GIMP 3.0 (finally migrated to GTK 3) is supposed to release
at some point next year.

Graphics drivers are in the best situation they've ever been, thanks to AMD. With a recent enough kernel,
AMD graphics are plug-and-play, and they work on Wayland too! And because of the popularity of machine learning,
some distros (notably PopOS) have turned Nvidia graphics into something usable. Not great, but usable.

At some point, Linus Torvalds said "when Microsoft makes software for Linux, I'll know I won".
We reached that point some years ago. Which brings me to my next point

## Windows doesn't have a future
