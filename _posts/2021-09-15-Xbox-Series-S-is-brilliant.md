title: The Xbox Series S is brilliant
---

This generation, Microsoft simultaneously launched two consoles, the Xbox Series X (the powerful, expensive one) and the Series S, a smaller and cheaper all-digital version, that should run all the same games, but with weaker graphics.

![The two consoles in question.](https://cdn.hobbyconsolas.com/sites/navi.axelspringer.es/public/styles/2400/public/media/image/2020/09/xbox-series-x-xbox-series-s-2060597.jpg)

Aside from the same games, the two consoles also share compatibility with accessories, and game progression saves are automatically synchronized.

## Stock shortages

Just in case you don't know, the whole tech world has been facing shortages this last year, because of production issues and higher demand. The powerful consoles (PS5 and series X) and computer GPUs are frequently sold by scalpers at higher prices, with the exact prices varying by region.

For some reason, however, the Series S has been more consistently available (in my country, and according to some reddit comments in other countries as well). I think this is intentional on Microsoft's part, you'll understand why if you keep on reading.

## Margins

Consoles are traditionally sold at razor-thin margins, sometimes even at a loss for the manufacturer, hoping to make the money back with percentages on the games.
This way, people are more willing to buy the consoles, which expands their market.

The Series S in particular has been praised for its impressive price to performance ratio, hinting that Microsoft is saving _every_ penny they can. $Â 300 is probably the lowest price a device this powerful can be made, period.

Yet, they probably _would_ sell it for cheaper if they could, considering they make a lot more money by selling games (or game-related services) than consoles. If only there was a way to lower the price even more...

## The second hand market

Unlike other consoles[^other], the Series S-to-X upgrade is probably worth doing for a lot of people. And it's extremely easy to do, considering that:

1. The Series S is all-digital, so you'll keep your games.
1. Game saves are on the cloud, so you'll keep your progress on those games.
2. All accessories are compatible with both consoles.

So, as the stock shortages are handled, and the Series X becomes available at reasonable prices, it is very likely that people will upgrade to that one, and sell their Series S. This should inject the market with lots of used Series S's, making the price drop. And that price drop doesn't make Microsoft lose money, it's the people selling used that are taking that hit.

Usually, when selling a used console, people bundle it with their games. For the Series S that is close to impossible, considering it's all-digital and games are tied to your account. The console doesn't even have different colors, there is a single model, every (working) Series S should be the same. This is the closest any product can get to what economists call perfect competition.

So what do you get when you combine a lot of people selling used and close-to-perfect competition? Lower prices, ASAP.

_This is already happening in my country._ Unlike every other console, used Xbox Series S's are sold significantly below their MSRP. Hell, most used slim PS4's are more expensive than used Series S's. That's a _7 years older_ device.

## Any advice on buying one?

I don't have one. I plan on getting it near the end of the year, when games like Forza Horizon and Halo Infinite are released, if people say the games are good. I don't think it's worth getting a console that doesn't have games[^backcompat].

Alternatively, you can just wait until the Series X shortages end, which should lower the price of the second-hand Series S even more. But I have no idea when this will happen.

[^backcompat]: It does have a lot of games via backwards compatibility. However, XSS runs the Xbox One S versions of them, which many times doesn't even reach consistent 1080p 30fps. Graphics don't matter _that_ much, but at this point I would consider a Switch for the convenience instead.

[^other]: Mostly meaning the PS5, but The Nintendo Switch counts too, I think, because the OLED model just isn't enough reason to upgrade for most people.
