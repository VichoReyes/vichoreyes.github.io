I have thought about making this decision many times, but I always change my mind when something interesting props up. This time I'm publishing it as a
way to force myself to do it. No more games, no more gamepass or stuff, until I finish the games I already bought[^elden].

[^elden]: These games include Elden Ring, Yakuza 0 and Witcher 3, games I'll probably never finish, so I don't think I'm going to buy anything ever again.

Why make this choice? I feel guilty about giving money to a company that
takes the wrong road at every turn.

This means I won't play Outer Wilds, Rollerdrome or Cocoon, at least not on this platform. Well, it's impossible to play every good game that comes out.
